# Clickbait Detector

This repository aims to implement various models to detect click-baits. 

## Data
I extracted the data from : https://github.com/bhargaviparanjape/clickbait/tree/master/dataset

## Requirements :

 1. Python 2.7
 2. NLTK for python 2.7
 

## Models :

 1. Naive Bayes : 81% accuracy for 3000 features.
 2. Naive Bayes : 91% accuracy for 5000 features.
 

## Scope : 
I plan to make an API using the best model and then implement a chrome extension for the same.
